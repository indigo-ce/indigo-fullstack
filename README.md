### AI-assisted Bootstrap

This project comes with a script that can help you bootstrap a new project.
The script uses Claude Code to rename the project, update the README, and update the project name in the code.

To use the script, run `node scripts/bootstrap.js <project-name>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script assumes you have a working installation of Claude Code.
> if you don't have or rather use another tool, you can run the script with the `--prompt-only` flag to get the prompt and apply it manually in your favorite AI tooling.

## Authentication

This template uses Better Auth for authentication. And supports these features out of the box:

1. **Sign Up**: Users can create an account with name, email, and password
2. **Sign In**: Users can log in with their email and password
3. **Protected Routes**: The dashboard is protected and requires authentication
4. **Sign Out**: Users can log out from their account
5. **Email Verification**: Users can verify their email address
6. **Password Reset**: Users can reset their password
7. **Account Deletion**: Users can delete their account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, email verification is not required to sign in. You may want to change this behavior in `src/lib/auth.ts`.

> [!NOTE]
> New accounts store their password as a `$pbkdf2$…` PBKDF2-SHA256 hash derived through Web Crypto in `src/lib/password.ts`. A project already generated from this template that carries live credential accounts needs the legacy delegation branch in `src/lib/password.ts`'s `verifyPassword` before adopting this change, so those accounts keep signing in.

### Test Credentials (Development)

For local development and testing, you can use these

- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `TestPassword123!`

> [!NOTE]
> No test user is created by default. You'll need to sign up through the `/sign-up` page to create your first account. Feel free to use different credentials if preferred.
> During local development and CI, emails are logged to the console rather than sent (see [Email Behavior in Different Environments](#email-behavior-in-different-environments)), so the verification email never arrives. Users created this way will need their email manually verified in the database for testing purposes (e.g., `UPDATE user SET emailVerified = 1 WHERE email = 'your@email.com'`).

### Better Auth

You **must** set the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` secret in your production environment (e.g., Cloudflare Pages). If this variable is not set, Better Auth will throw an error.

For local development, you can add this variable to the `.dev.vars` file (copied from `.dev.vars.example`).

You can generate a secure secret using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the generated string. Then, add it as a secret named `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` using wrangler CLI for your production environment:

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
```

Also configure `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL` in your `wrangler.jsonc` file under the `vars` section for production. To allow additional origins (for example preview deployments), set the optional comma-separated `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` var alongside it. When testing against `pnpm dev` through a tunnel hostname, name that host in both `ASTRO_DEV_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (so the dev server answers it) and `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` (so auth accepts the origin).

### Plunk

This template uses [Plunk](https://useplunk.com) for email functionality.

`PLUNK_API_KEY` is read by the email consumer worker (`workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/`), not by the app Worker. The app only queues messages to the `EMAIL_QUEUE` binding; the consumer worker sends them to Plunk.

To set up Plunk for production, create an account and set the `PLUNK_API_KEY` secret on the consumer worker:

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put PLUNK_API_KEY --config workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/wrangler.jsonc
```

For local development, `wrangler dev` loads a Worker's local variables from the `.dev.vars` file next to its config, so put the key in `workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/.dev.vars` (already gitignored there) if you want to exercise real delivery through `pnpm email-worker:dev`.
The sender email address (`SEND_EMAIL_FROM`) should be configured in the worker's `wrangler.jsonc` file under the `vars` section for production.

### Astro Session

The Astro Sessions API allows you to easily store user data between requests.
This can be used for things like user data and preferences, shopping carts, and
authentication credentials. Unlike cookie storage, there are no size limits on
the data, and it can be restored on different devices.

Before using sessions, you need to create a KV namespace to store the data and
configure a KV binding in your Wrangler config file.

```bash
pnpm wrangler kv namespace create "SESSION" # default name
```

Add the returned ID to `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "SESSION",
    "id": "<KV_NAMESPACE_ID>"
  }
]
```

## Database

This template uses Drizzle ORM with Cloudflare D1 for a modern, type-safe, serverless SQL database.

- The schema is defined using Drizzle's sqliteTable helpers for tables.
- The Drizzle config (`drizzle.config.ts`) uses the local D1 database specified in `.wrangler/state/v3/d1` for Drizzle Kit commands like `db:generate`. It does not require separate Cloudflare credentials for local development.

### Database Schema

The database schema includes:

- Users
- Sessions
- Accounts
- Verification tokens

### Creating a D1 Database

To create a D1 database for your project:

```bash
# Initialize the local database for development
pnpm db:init:local

# Create a D1 database in Cloudflare for production
pnpm db:init:prod

# After creating the database, you'll receive output with the database_id
# Add this to your wrangler.jsonc as shown in the example below
```

Example wrangler.jsonc configuration:

```jsonc
"d1_databases": [
  {
    "binding": "DB", // Must match preview_database_id
    "database_name": "your-project-name",
    "database_id": "your-d1-database-id", // The ID from the create command
    "migrations_dir": "./drizzle/migrations",
    "preview_database_id": "DB" // Required for Pages local development
  }
]
```

### Migrations

- Run `pnpm db:generate` to generate migrations from your schema.
- Run `pnpm db:migrate:local` to apply them locally.
- Run `pnpm db:migrate:prod` to apply them to production.

See the checklist above for more details.

> **Note:** You need to manually apply the migrations to your production database after every schema change.

### Backups

Run `pnpm db:backup` to write a SQL dump of the production D1 database to
`drizzle/backup.sql` (already gitignored). The script reads `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
`CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID`, and `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` from the process environment —
`.dev.vars` is a Wrangler file and Node does not load it, so export the variables in
your shell. `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID` is the `database_id` already recorded in
`wrangler.jsonc`. Run it from the repository root, since the dump path resolves
against the working directory.

### Studio

You can use the Drizzle Studio to view and edit your local database data.

```bash
pnpm db:studio:local
```

### Queries

Here's an example of how to query the database using Drizzle ORM:

```typescript
import {createDrizzle} from "@/db";

const db = createDrizzle(d1); // You can obtain and instance of D1Database from the context using the DB binding.
const userData = await db.select().from(user).where(eq(user.id, userId));

// Create a new user
const newUser = await db
  .insert(user)
  .values({
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com"
    // Other user fields
  })
  .returning();

// Join example: Fetch user with their active sessions
const userWithSessions = await db
  .select({
    id: user.id,
    name: user.name,
    sessionId: session.id
  })
  .from(user)
  .leftJoin(session, eq(session.userId, user.id))
  .where(eq(user.id, userId));
```

## Emails

The application uses an **asynchronous email queue system** powered by Cloudflare Queues. Emails are queued immediately and processed by a separate worker with its own CPU budget, preventing email sending from blocking user requests.

### Architecture

```
Request → queue.send(email) → Response (fast!)
              ↓
   [Email Queue Worker]
              ↓
   render(template) → send via Plunk
```

**Benefits:**

- Fast response times (no email rendering on request path)
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed messages
- Separate CPU budget for email processing
- Built-in batch processing

### Setup

#### 1. Create Cloudflare Queues

```bash
pnpm queue:create
```

This creates:

- `indigo-email-queue` - Primary queue for email messages
- `indigo-email-queue-dlq` - Dead letter queue for failed messages

#### 2. Configure Worker Secret

The email worker needs the Plunk API key:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put PLUNK_API_KEY --config workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/wrangler.jsonc
```

#### 3. Deploy Worker

```bash
pnpm email-worker:deploy
```

#### 4. Configure Main App

The main app configuration in `wrangler.jsonc` includes:

- Queue producer binding (`EMAIL_QUEUE`)
- Sender email address (`SEND_EMAIL_FROM`)

### Configuration

**Production:**

- Set `PLUNK_API_KEY` secret on the worker (step 2 above)
- Configure `SEND_EMAIL_FROM` in worker's `wrangler.jsonc`
- Deploy worker before deploying main app

**Local Development:**

- In dev mode, emails are logged to console (not actually queued)
- Optional: Run `pnpm email-worker:dev` in separate terminal to process queued emails locally
- Optionally add `PLUNK_API_KEY` to `workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/.dev.vars` if testing actual email delivery

### Email Templates

Email templates are built with React Email and include **localization support** (English and Japanese). Templates are stored in `src/components/email/`:

- `WelcomeEmail.tsx` - Welcome emails with locale-specific text
- `CustomEmail.tsx` - Custom message emails
- `BaseLayout.tsx` - Reusable email layout component
- `EmailVerification.tsx` - Email verification with translations
- `PasswordReset.tsx` - Password reset with translations
- `AccountDeleted.tsx` - Account deletion confirmation with translations

All templates support a `locale` prop to render content in the user's preferred language.

### Sending Emails

Emails are queued using the `queueEmail()` function:

```typescript
import {queueEmail} from "@/lib/email";

// Queue a welcome email
await queueEmail(
  "user@example.com",
  {type: "welcome", props: {name: "John"}},
  env,
  {locale: "en"} // Optional locale for translations
);

// Queue a custom email
await queueEmail(
  "user@example.com",
  {type: "custom", props: {html: "<p>Your message</p>"}},
  env,
  {subject: "Custom Subject", locale: "ja"}
);
```

The email is immediately queued and returns. The worker processes it asynchronously.

### Monitoring

**View worker logs:**

```bash
wrangler tail indigo-email-queue-consumer
```

**Check queue metrics:**

- Navigate to Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → Queues
- Monitor message throughput, consumer latency, and failed messages
- Dead letter queue captures messages that fail after max retries

### Preview Emails Templates

To preview emails locally, run:

```bash
pnpm preview-email
```

This command starts a local email viewer using the templates from the `src/components/email` directory.

## API

The API is built using Hono and comes with a hybrid JWT and refresh token authentication system, primarily for mobile applications. The API endpoints are organized in the `src/lib/hono/routes` directory.

Key features:

- JWT-based authentication
- Route protection using middlewares
- Structured response handling
- Integration with the Drizzle ORM database

API routes include:

- Authentication routes (`/api/auth/*`)
- User account management
- JWT refresh and token management

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant API
    participant JWTMiddleware
    participant JWKSCache

```

## Cloudflare Configuration

This template is configured to deploy to Cloudflare Pages with D1 Database and KV storage.

### Local Development

For local development, choose between two workflows:

- `pnpm dev` - Astro dev server (Node runtime, faster development)
- `pnpm preview` - Cloudflare Workers emulation via Wrangler (production parity)

Environment variables for local development can be placed in `.dev.vars`. Secrets like API keys should generally be kept out of version control. The `platformProxy` option in the Astro config makes this seamless.

### Production Deployment

To deploy to Cloudflare Workers with static assets:

1. Create a new Workers project in the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Link it to your GitHub repository
3. Configure the build command: `pnpm build`
4. Configure production environment variables and secrets (like `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`) in the Pages dashboard settings. The email consumer worker's `PLUNK_API_KEY` secret is set separately with wrangler (see the Plunk section above).
5. Migrate the production database.
6. Deploy!

> [!NOTE]
> Cloudflare Pages is not supported for this project.
> Attempts to deploy end up in a `[ERROR] Error: No such module "node:os".` error.
> This could be temporary, but as of 2025-05-04, it is not supported.

## Theming

This project uses TailwindCSS for styling.
The shadcn theme is defined in `src/styles.css`.

You can generate a new theme using your favorite tool ([example](https://themecn.dev/))
then copy-paste the variables.

### CSS Files

The template includes two CSS files:

- `src/styles.css` - Indigo brand colors (for the template showcase)
- `src/_styles.css` - Neutral colors for starting new projects

When using the bootstrap script (`node scripts/bootstrap.js <project-name>`), the branded `styles.css` is automatically deleted and `_styles.css` is renamed to `styles.css` to give you a clean neutral color palette to start with.

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive test coverage with both unit tests (Vitest) and end-to-end tests (Playwright).

### Running Tests

| Command                 | Action                               |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `pnpm test`             | Run unit tests in watch mode         |
| `pnpm test:run`         | Run unit tests once                  |
| `pnpm test:e2e`         | Run all e2e tests                    |
| `pnpm test:e2e:ui`      | Run e2e tests in interactive UI mode |
| `pnpm test:e2e:headed`  | Run e2e tests with visible browser   |
| `pnpm test:e2e:debug`   | Debug e2e tests step-by-step         |
| `pnpm test:e2e:codegen` | Generate e2e tests visually          |
| `pnpm test:e2e:report`  | View last test report                |

### Email Behavior in Different Environments

Email sending is decided by one rule in `queueEmail()` (`src/lib/email.ts`): when
`BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL` contains `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, the message is logged to
the console; otherwise it is queued to Cloudflare Queues, where the consumer worker
renders it and sends it via Plunk. The Plunk API key plays no part in that decision.

- **Local development** — `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4321` from `.dev.vars` puts the app in console-logging mode. No queue or Plunk setup is needed. Run `pnpm email-worker:dev` in a second terminal to consume the queue locally.
- **CI / E2E tests** — the Test workflow sets `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787`, so emails are logged and never sent; no Plunk key is configured anywhere in CI.
- **Production** — a real hostname queues every email. Set `PLUNK_API_KEY` on the consumer worker (see the Plunk section above) or delivery fails when the worker processes the queue.

Users created against a local or CI base URL never receive a verification email, so
they need their `emailVerified` flag set manually (e.g., `UPDATE user SET
emailVerified = 1 WHERE email = 'test@example.com'`).

### Summary: Email Sending Decision Tree

```shell
Is local development (localhost)?
├─ YES → Log to console (not queued)
└─ NO → Queue email for async delivery via Plunk
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Middleware, utilities, and business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user flows
  - Authentication (sign-up, sign-in, protected routes)
  - Internationalization (language switching)
  - Form validation and error handling

All tests run automatically in CI on every pull request.
