### AI-assisted Bootstrap

This project comes with a script that can help you bootstrap a new project.
The script uses Claude Code to rename the project, update the README, and update the project name in the code.

To use the script, run `node scripts/bootstrap.js <project-name>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script assumes you have a working installation of Claude Code.
> if you don't have or rather use another tool, you can run the script with the `--prompt-only` flag to get the prompt and apply it manually in your favorite AI tooling.

## Authentication

This template uses Better Auth for authentication. And supports these features out of the box:

1. **Sign Up**: Users can create an account with name, email, and password
2. **Sign In**: Users can log in with their email and password
3. **Protected Routes**: The dashboard is protected and requires authentication
4. **Sign Out**: Users can log out from their account
5. **Email Verification**: Users can verify their email address
6. **Password Reset**: Users can reset their password
7. **Account Deletion**: Users can delete their account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, email verification is not required to sign in. You may want to change this behavior in `src/lib/auth.ts`.

### Better Auth

You **must** set the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` secret in your production environment (e.g., Cloudflare Pages). If this variable is not set, Better Auth will throw an error.

For local development, you can add this variable to the `.dev.vars` file (copied from `.dev.vars.example`).

You can generate a secure secret using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the generated string. Then, add it as a secret named `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` using wrangler CLI for your production environment:

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
```

Also configure `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL` in your `wrangler.jsonc` file under the `vars` section for production.

### Resend

This template uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for email functionality.

To set up Resend for production, create an account and set the `RESEND_API_KEY` secret using wrangler CLI:

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
```

For local development, add `RESEND_API_KEY` to your `.dev.vars` file.
The sender email address (`SEND_EMAIL_FROM`) should be configured in your `wrangler.jsonc` file under the `vars` section for production.

#### Development Testing with resend.dev

For local development, Indigo Stack automatically uses Resend's testing domains to avoid domain verification issues:

- **All verification emails** are sent to `delivered@resend.dev` (instead of real user emails)
- **Sender address** uses `onboarding@resend.dev` (no domain verification required)
- **Full functionality** - You can test the complete email verification flow

**Available test scenarios:**

- `delivered@resend.dev` - Test successful email delivery
- `bounced@resend.dev` - Test email bounces
- `complained@resend.dev` - Test spam marking

This setup allows you to test email verification without:

- Domain verification requirements
- Real email addresses
- SMTP configuration
- External email services

Simply sign up with any email address locally, and the verification email will be sent to `delivered@resend.dev`. Check your [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/emails) to see the delivery.

### Astro Session

The Astro Sessions API allows you to easily store user data between requests.
This can be used for things like user data and preferences, shopping carts, and
authentication credentials. Unlike cookie storage, there are no size limits on
the data, and it can be restored on different devices.

Before using sessions, you need to create a KV namespace to store the data and
configure a KV binding in your Wrangler config file.

```bash
pnpm wrangler kv namespace create "SESSION" # default name
```

Add the returned ID to `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "SESSION",
    "id": "<KV_NAMESPACE_ID>"
  }
]
```

## Database

This template uses Drizzle ORM with Cloudflare D1 for a modern, type-safe, serverless SQL database.

- The schema is defined using Drizzle's sqliteTable helpers for tables.
- The Drizzle config (`drizzle.config.ts`) uses the local D1 database specified in `.wrangler/state/v3/d1` for Drizzle Kit commands like `db:generate`. It does not require separate Cloudflare credentials for local development.

### Database Schema

The database schema includes:

- Users
- Sessions
- Accounts
- Verification tokens

### Creating a D1 Database

To create a D1 database for your project:

```bash
# Initialize the local database for development
pnpm db:init:local

# Create a D1 database in Cloudflare for production
pnpm db:init:prod

# After creating the database, you'll receive output with the database_id
# Add this to your wrangler.jsonc as shown in the example below
```

Example wrangler.jsonc configuration:

```jsonc
"d1_databases": [
  {
    "binding": "DB", // Must match preview_database_id
    "database_name": "your-project-name",
    "database_id": "your-d1-database-id", // The ID from the create command
    "migrations_dir": "./drizzle/migrations",
    "preview_database_id": "DB" // Required for Pages local development
  }
]
```

### Migrations

- Run `pnpm db:generate` to generate migrations from your schema.
- Run `pnpm d1:migrate:local` to apply them locally.
- Run `pnpm d1:migrate:prod` to apply them to production.

See the checklist above for more details.

> **Note:** You need to manually apply the migrations to your production database after every schema change.

### Studio

You can use the Drizzle Studio to view and edit your local database data.

```bash
pnpm d1:studio:local
```

### Queries

Here's an example of how to query the database using Drizzle ORM:

```typescript
import {createDrizzle} from "@/db";

const db = createDrizzle(d1); // You can obtain and instance of D1Database from the context using the DB binding.
const userData = await db.select().from(user).where(eq(user.id, userId));

// Create a new user
const newUser = await db
  .insert(user)
  .values({
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com"
    // Other user fields
  })
  .returning();

// Join example: Fetch user with their active sessions
const userWithSessions = await db
  .select({
    id: user.id,
    name: user.name,
    sessionId: session.id
  })
  .from(user)
  .leftJoin(session, eq(session.userId, user.id))
  .where(eq(user.id, userId));
```

## Emails

The application includes built-in email functionality using [Resend](https://resend.com) exclusively for both development and production.

### Configuration

For production, configure the following:

- Set the `RESEND_API_KEY` secret using `pnpm wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY`.
- Set the `SEND_EMAIL_FROM` variable in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars`.

For local development:

- Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to your `.dev.vars` file for local email testing.
- The `SEND_EMAIL_FROM` variable from `wrangler.jsonc` will be used if available during `wrangler dev`.

### Email Templates

Email templates are built with React Email for improved type safety, maintainability, and design consistency. Templates are stored in `src/components/email/`:

- `WelcomeEmail.tsx` - Template for welcome emails
- `CustomEmail.tsx` - Template for custom message emails
- `BaseLayout.tsx` - Reusable email layout component
- `EmailVerification.tsx` - Template for email verification
- `PasswordReset.tsx` - Template for password reset emails
- `ChangeEmailVerification.tsx` - Template for email change verification
- `AccountDeleted.tsx` - Template for account deletion confirmation

### Sending Emails

```typescript
import {sendEmail} from "@/actions/email";

// Send a welcome email
await sendEmail({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Welcome to Indigo Stack CE!",
  template: {name: "welcome", params: {name: "John"}}
});

// Send a custom email
await sendEmail({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Important Information",
  template: {name: "custom", params: {html: "<p>Your custom message here</p>"}}
});
```

### Sending Test Emails

Visit `/email-demo` to try the email functionality. In development, emails are sent via Resend's testing domains.

### Preview Emails Templates

To preview emails locally, run:

```bash
pnpm preview-email
```

This command starts a local email viewer using the templates from the `src/components/email` directory.

## API

The API is built using Hono and comes with a hybrid JWT and refresh token authentication system, primarily for mobile applications. The API endpoints are organized in the `src/lib/hono/routes` directory.

Key features:

- JWT-based authentication
- Route protection using middlewares
- Structured response handling
- Integration with the Drizzle ORM database

API routes include:

- Authentication routes (`/api/auth/*`)
- User account management
- JWT refresh and token management

```

## Cloudflare Configuration

This template is configured to deploy to Cloudflare Pages with D1 Database and KV storage.

### Local Development

For local development, choose between two workflows:

- `pnpm dev` - Astro dev server (Node runtime, faster development)
- `pnpm preview` - Cloudflare Workers emulation via Wrangler (production parity)

Environment variables for local development can be placed in `.dev.vars`. Secrets like API keys should generally be kept out of version control. The `platformProxy` option in the Astro config makes this seamless.

### Production Deployment

To deploy to Cloudflare Workers with static assets:

1. Create a new Workers project in the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Link it to your GitHub repository
3. Configure the build command: `pnpm build`
4. Configure production environment variables and secrets (like `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`) in the Pages dashboard settings.
5. Migrate the production database.
6. Deploy!

> [!NOTE]
> Cloudflare Pages is not supported for this project.
> Attempts to deploy end up in a `[ERROR] Error: No such module "node:os".` error.
> This could be temporary, but as of 2025-05-04, it is not supported.

## Theming

This project uses TailwindCSS for styling.
The shadcn theme is defined in `src/styles.css`.

You can generate a new theme using your favorite tool ([example](https://themecn.dev/))
then copy-paste the variables.
