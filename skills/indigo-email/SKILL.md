# Email Queue System

Indigo stack projects use an asynchronous email queue powered by Cloudflare Queues. Email rendering and delivery happen in a dedicated worker with its own CPU budget — they never block user requests.

## Architecture

```
User Request → Main App → queueEmail() → Cloudflare Queue → Email Worker → Plunk API
                                    (instant)            (async)
```

The email worker: renders the React Email template, sends via Plunk, retries on failure (exponential backoff: 30s / 60s / 120s, max 3 retries), moves failures to the dead letter queue.

In local development, `queueEmail()` logs to console instead of queuing — no queue setup needed locally.

## Queuing Emails

Import `queueEmail` from `@/lib/email`:

```typescript
import {queueEmail} from "@/lib/email";

// Basic
await queueEmail("user@example.com", {type: "welcome", props: {name: "John"}}, env);

// With locale
await queueEmail(
  "user@example.com",
  {type: "email-verification", props: {name: "John", url: verificationUrl}},
  env,
  {locale: "ja"}
);

// With custom subject
await queueEmail(to, {type: "custom", props: {html: "<p>…</p>"}}, env, {subject: "Custom Subject"});
```

Always pass `locale` from the user object or request headers so emails arrive in the user's language.

## Available Templates

All templates support `en` and `ja` locales:

| Type | Required props |
|---|---|
| `email-verification` | `name: string, url: string` |
| `password-reset` | `name: string, resetLink: string` |
| `account-deleted` | `name: string` |
| `welcome` | `name: string` |
| `custom` | `html: string, title?: string, preview?: string` |

## Adding a New Template

1. Create a React Email component in `src/components/email/`.
2. Add the template type and props to the `EmailTemplate` union in `src/lib/email-queue.ts`.
3. Add a `case` to the worker's switch statement in `workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/src/index.ts`.
4. Add translation strings for the subject line to `src/translations/en.json` and `src/translations/ja.json`.
5. Test with `pnpm preview-email`.

## Initial Setup

Run once per deployment environment:

```bash
# 1. Create queues (primary + dead letter)
pnpm queue:create

# 2. Install worker deps
cd workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer && pnpm install && cd ../..

# 3. Regenerate Cloudflare types (adds EMAIL_QUEUE binding)
pnpm cf-types

# 4. Set worker secret
npx wrangler secret put PLUNK_API_KEY --config workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/wrangler.jsonc

# 5. Deploy worker (before main app)
pnpm email-worker:deploy
```

## Configuration

### Main app `wrangler.jsonc`

```jsonc
{
  "queues": {
    "producers": [{"binding": "EMAIL_QUEUE", "queue": "indigo-email-queue"}]
  },
  "vars": {
    "SEND_EMAIL_FROM": "Your App <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
  }
}
```

### Worker `workers/indigo-email-queue-consumer/wrangler.jsonc`

```jsonc
{
  "name": "indigo-email-queue-consumer",
  "queues": {
    "consumers": [{
      "queue": "indigo-email-queue",
      "max_batch_size": 10,
      "max_batch_timeout": 30,
      "max_retries": 3,
      "dead_letter_queue": "indigo-email-queue-dlq"
    }]
  },
  "vars": {
    "SEND_EMAIL_FROM": "Your App <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
  }
}
```

## Local Development with Full Queue

To test the actual queue flow locally, run both servers:

```bash
# Terminal 1
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2
pnpm email-worker:dev
```

Without Terminal 2, `queueEmail()` still works — it just logs to console.

## Monitoring

```bash
# Stream live worker logs
wrangler tail indigo-email-queue-consumer

# Inspect dead letter queue
wrangler queues consumer view indigo-email-queue-dlq
```

Queue metrics (messages in queue, throughput, latency, failures) are visible in the Cloudflare dashboard under **Workers & Pages → Queues → indigo-email-queue**.

## Migrating from `sendEmail()`

Replace synchronous sends with queued sends — the worker handles rendering:

```typescript
// Before
import {sendEmail} from "@/lib/email";
import {render} from "@react-email/render";
import WelcomeEmail from "@/components/email/WelcomeEmail";

await sendEmail(to, "Welcome!", await render(WelcomeEmail({name})), env);

// After
import {queueEmail} from "@/lib/email";

await queueEmail(to, {type: "welcome", props: {name}}, env, {locale: "en"});
```

Remove all `render()` calls — that work moves to the worker.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Check |
|---|---|
| Worker deploy fails | `PLUNK_API_KEY` secret set? Run `wrangler secret put` |
| Emails queued but not delivered | Worker deployed? Plunk key valid? Run `wrangler tail` |
| Messages accumulating in DLQ | Worker logs for error details; check Plunk rate limits and template errors |
| Main app hitting CPU limits | Verify `queueEmail()` used everywhere, not `sendEmail()` |
